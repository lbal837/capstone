## Setup and Running

1. Set up the Fitbit OS Simulator
2. If running for the first time, run `npm i`
3. To run the application run `npx fitbit` then `bi` -> means build and install (not the other one)

## Testing and Developing

- If you wanna test the fetch requests, hit the login button on the Fitbit phone simulator (which should show up after
running `bi`)
- All the back-end functions are somewhere on lambda so gl with that
